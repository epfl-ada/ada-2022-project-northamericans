# How has representation in film evolved over time?

- Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

Using the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset we want to paint a picture of the evolving landscape of representation in movies. With recent events shedding light on the oppression of minorities in all kinds of different industries and areas of society, we are curious to discover whether or not progress has been made in the film industry. We aim to determine if minority actors have appeared more frequently in movies in more recent times, whether or not they have held important roles, and how they have been portrayed in the roles they do receive. We will analyze castings in conjunction with movie summaries to answer these questions and ultimately try to determine how representation in film has changed over time. We hope that answering this question will provide insight into the progressiveness of the film industry and identify areas for potential improvement.
